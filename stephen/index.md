I'm Stephen Niedzielski. I'm a programmer.

My pronouns are he/him.

I grew up in Pennsylvania. I currently live in the city of Denver, Colorado of
the United States with my partner, J.

I had a mix of public and homeschooling as well as a year of commercial arts
vocational school. I graduated with a bachelor's of science in computer
engineering from DigiPen Institute of Technology.

I publish select works under [oidoid](https://oidoid.com).

My email address is [stephen@niedzielski.com](mailto:stephen@niedzielski.com).

I hack at Reddit on the Developer Platform team. See
[my resume (PDF)](stephen-niedzielski-resume.pdf).

Programming is at the center of my life. Mostly TypeScript these days.
