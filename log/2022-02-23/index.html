This is another. It&#39;s
always with the same sorts of aspirations: 1) build a platform to express myself
easily 2) consolidate my work and ideas in one place that I own 3) connect with
others.</p>
<p>The last two iterations of this website were primitive single file sites that
mostly skipped #1 and linked to other platforms. It was very easy to maintain
that one page but not everything I wish to share fits into the constraints of
that design.</p>
<p>I intentionally took a no modesty approach this iteration so I could finish it
hastily before I start my new job. It&#39;s so messy!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve broken the site up into a few broad sections that fit my plans. It&#39;s the
only thing I paused to think about this time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works: technical and nontechnical projects. For example, I think I would put
my favorite project, swankmania, here even though it may no longer exist and
the page is more of a postmortem. It&#39;s about creating something mostly whole.
A book would probably go here. A finished drawing would go here.</li>
<li>Notes: Essays and writings. This directory may encompass a broad range of
topics from my favorite Nintendo Entertainment System games to comparing
different TypeScript programming styles.</li>
<li>Log: My thinking is that writings I put in the log will never be revised
significantly (and therefore literally less polished). If I might make changes
to an article, I will try not to put it here. The only other characteristic
trait of logs is that they&#39;ll probably be more focused on a moment in time and
may be more of a smattering of topics than a deep dive.</li>
<li>Profile: this is a pretty conventional &quot;about me&quot; page. I may make this more
in-depth (eg, I could add a photos section), but I think it&#39;s more likely to
stay light.</li>
</ul>
<p>They all kind of overlap but have worthwhile distinctions.</p>
<p>Lots of work remains but, if nothing else, it was a fun experiment to explore
<a href="https://deno.land">Deno</a>.</p>
