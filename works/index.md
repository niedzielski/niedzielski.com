Here are some projects I've made meaningful contributions to while at Wikimedia:

- [Wikimedia Vue User Interface component library](https://github.com/wikimedia/wvui):
  Technically, a fine Vue.js library for Wikipedia, MediaWiki, and beyond.
  Socially, an amazing journey for Wikimedia.
- [Page Previews](https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Page_Previews): Intelligent summary
  dialogs shown when hovering over Wikipedia article links.
- [Desktop Improvements Project](https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Desktop_Improvements):
  An overhaul of the Wikipedia user interface.
- [Wikipedia for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wikipedia)
  and the [Node.js backend service](https://github.com/wikimedia/mobileapps):
  Wikipedia's native Android application. The backend service serves both data
  and cross-platform (Android / iOS) WebView presentation.
- [Marvin](https://github.com/wikimedia/marvin): An isomorphic TypeScript Preact
  web app version of Wikipedia.
- [Wikipedia Mobile](https://mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Minerva_Neue): The
  Wikipedia mobile site.

My personal works include:

- [oidoid](https://oidoid.com): Games, games, games. Actually, just one and it's
  not done yet.
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/niedzielski/dotfiles): My Ubuntu system
  configuration.
- [swankmania](https://github.com/niedzielski/swankmania): A "Game Boy with
  vector graphics."
- [01](https://github.com/niedzielski/01): 64 pxÂ² The Matrix themed WebGL
  shader.
- [Cooking Recipes](https://github.com/niedzielski/cooking-recipes): My
  cookbook. How did you live without it? How will you live with it?
- [git-diff-img](https://github.com/niedzielski/git-diff-img): Diff Git
  versioned images graphically.
- [cb](https://github.com/niedzielski/cb): Clipboard Evolved. Actually just a
  command-line clipboard with automatic copy and paste detection. Eg,
  `cb|sort|cb`.
- [shebang](https://github.com/niedzielski/shebang): A silly collection of
  single file programs that can be interpreted both as shell scripts and another
  language. The first interpretation is just to invoke the second with
  arguments.

Where did the time go?
